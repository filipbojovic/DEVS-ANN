# Artificial Neural Network Based on Discrete Event System formalism

In this project, an artificial neural network has been created from scratch using the DEVS formalism.
Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) is a formalism that enables modeling and simulating discrete systems with hierarchy and modularity. Systems are structured using atomic and coupled models, while behavior is described by current states and input/output events. Each system described using DEVS has input and output ports for communication with the external environment. Atomic models can be connected to form complex coupled models, defining their behavior through interactions between atomic models. A system can have multiple coupled models. DEVS can represent any real system as a collection of atomic and coupled models

Components of the neural network, such as neurons, connections between neurons, and bias neurons, are represented by atomic models, and all atomic models are connected within a coupled model, which represents the artificial neural network.
